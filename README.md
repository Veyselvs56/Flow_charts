# Flow_charts
It contains simple demonstration examples of the algorithm with the Flowgorithm application. You can translate these flowcharts into programming languages ​​that the application allows.
There are a total of 14 flowchart applications in the file. Applications are listed from simple to difficult.To see, change and edit Flowgorithm projects http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/
To use the Flowgorithm application, you can install it from this link.

The application has a simple interface and language selection that you can learn on your own. 
Examples have been developed to learn the logic and basis of the algorithm.
These examples may be amateurish since I did them in first grade, but they will help learn the algorithm and programming logic.

Below are images of the application.
